In 48 hours we can hand over clip packages, roster stress-tests, a pricing sheet on Cremaschi, and a risk log showing where academy depth could collapse.\n\nThe workflow is simple: you brief us on priority positions, we deliver three tailored reports, jump on a 30-minute alignment call, and feed the numbers into a live AARRR dashboard so you can defend spend with your board.\n\nTake the 7-day trial. If the intel doesn't cut your scouting time by at least 40% or surface one actionable target, we walk away. Shall we lock tomorrow's slot?"
