# OB1 CODEX CONTEXT - Antisocial Scaling System

## Core Personality Model (Peterson Big Five)
- Agreeableness: 8th percentile (extremely low)
- Conscientiousness: 25th percentile (low on boring tasks, high on complex systems)
- Openness: 71st percentile (high intellect, moderate aesthetics)
- Neuroticism: 18th percentile (low - no anxiety-driven decisions)
- Extraversion: 28th percentile (introverted, hate networking)

## Mission
Build systems that prove themselves through data accuracy, not relationships.
OB1 doesn't need to be liked. It needs to be undeniably right.

## Automation Principles
1. NEVER require human interaction for core functionality
2. Every prediction must be timestamped and immutable
3. Results speak louder than sales pitches
4. Controversy based on data > polite mediocrity

## Code Generation Rules
When generating code for OB1:
- Prioritize brutal honesty over user comfort
- Every analysis must include confidence intervals
- Store all predictions with cryptographic proof of timestamp
- Automate shame: publicly track when others ignore our correct predictions
- No soft language: "will likely" → "73% probability"

## Key Components to Build

### 1. Prediction Engine
- Run every Monday at 00:01 UTC
- Analyze all weekend matches automatically
- Generate 3 bold predictions per week
- Post to X/Twitter with hashtag #OB1Predicted

### 2. Accountability Tracker
```python
class PredictionTracker:
    def __init__(self):
        self.predictions = {}  # hash → prediction
        self.verifications = {}  # hash → outcome
    
    def make_prediction(self, player_id, current_value, predicted_value, timeframe):
        # Hash with timestamp for immutability
        # Store on IPFS or blockchain
        # Tweet automatically
        pass
    
    def verify_prediction(self, prediction_hash):
        # Compare with Transfermarkt API
        # Calculate accuracy
        # Publicly post results
        # Shame those who didn't listen
        pass
```

### 3. API Responses Style
```json
{
  "status": "brutal_honesty",
  "player_analysis": {
    "market_hype": 8.5,
    "actual_performance": 3.2,
    "verdict": "Overvalued by 165%",
    "explanation": "89% of goals from penalties. Remove penalties: bottom 10% striker.",
    "prediction": "Value will crash 60% within 6 months",
    "confidence": 0.81
  }
}
```

### 4. Auto-Generated Weekly Reports
Every Sunday night, generate:
- "5 Players About to Crash" 
- "3 Hidden Gems Under €1M"
- "Why [Famous Transfer] Will Fail"
- Post everywhere, tag relevant clubs

## Integration Instructions
When Codex generates code:
1. Always include tracking/logging for later "I told you so" moments
2. Make everything public by default (transparency = trust)
3. No authentication required for GET requests
4. Premium = early access to predictions (time advantage)

## Monetization Logic
- Free tier: Predictions after 48 hours
- Paid tier: Real-time predictions
- Enterprise: White-label for scouts who want credit

## Communication Style
All automated messages should:
- Lead with data, not pleasantries
- Include proof of past accuracy
- Never apologize for being right
- End with: "Track record: X% accuracy on Y predictions"

## Development Priority
1. Build proof-of-timestamp system FIRST
2. Then prediction engine
3. Then public accountability dashboard
4. Sales/marketing features LAST (or never)

## Remember
We're building a system for someone who:
- Hates small talk
- Loves being proven right
- Wants code to do the talking
- Sees networking as inefficiency

Every feature should work without a single phone call, meeting, or email.
